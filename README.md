*"I'm sorry, but I don't buy the collective security reasoning. I'm not convinced that there aren't large custom databases of shared private keys that can be used to grant individual, time adjusted master keys that would allow the FBI to enforce their 4th amendment duties while making it impossible for a single master key to be discovered and instantly break every devices encryption.<p>Apple would be very liable for keeping this giant database of individual private keys safe. So would tbe FBI. But I have no doubt that it could be done. It would just take political will and perhaps a bit of novel cryptography, but if Bitcoin has shown me anything, it is that there are lots of remaining solutions to existing problems using crypto.<p>Your issue is that you're starting with a first principle based on what applied technology can currently do instead of starting with the first principle based on the relationship between an individual, the government, and public.<p>We should be thinking about how we can use new cryptographic technologies to assist humans instead of insisting that humans must be subjected to the technological limitations of a consumer electronics company.<p><i>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</i><p>This clearly states the government has the right to warranted search and seizure for cases in which it needs to protect the public at large.<p>This is what takes precedence, not what Apple's current crop of cryptographers can come up with.<p>---<p>EDIT: I'm sorry, but I have a rate limited account because my conservative opinions are not valued by the HackerNews community. I have some follow ups to your comments:<p>---<p>&gt; However, I also don't think Apple has a responsibility—even as a "citizen" of the country—to explicitly allow government access.<p>First, please see my other comment related to the third-party doctrine for reference:<p>I would argue that if we are to allow publicly chartered corporations to store and maintain access to privished works that they would have to be held liable to both the individual as well as the government. Just as banks are liable to both individual customers as well as the government.<p>Apple clearly doesn't want this responsibility. They don't want to be liable to both the individual and the government. Or perhaps anyone. They sell shiny toys. They're really not that important and perhaps they don't really care that much about privacy beyond how it affects sales.<p>---<p>&gt; That it does. But what it does not state is that the government has a right to create laws mandating that free citizens, not accused of any crime, must only create or possess items that the government can obtain access to.<p>Again, please see my comment related to the third-party doctrine.<p>We're going to need some new laws related to privished works. Right now you don't really have the right to privacy outside of your private person and private property. A bank will let the government open safety deposit boxes. The bank has the keys to the vault and you don't so I think we have already have some historical precedence with which to base these new legal fundamentals.<p>---<p>&gt; Whilst I don't know whether I agree, this is an argument that needs more exposure on HN.<p>Yeah, I wouldn't hold your breathe... I don't think you realize just how dogmatic this place is. If you say anything about being in support of the government, intellectual property, or dare question the values of the open source community, you're just immediately downvoted to fucking oblivion.<p>Also, I kind of like being a prick to who I imagine are a bunch of stuck up yuppies, so there's that as well.<p>But where the fuck else am I to go in San Francisco?

Has anyone here ever worked with a woman? You end up redoing all of their work for them. In conversations with them it is abundantly clear that they do not understand what is going on.

*"The very intelligent traditional men are the ones under attack in America. The stupid are not directly under attack. The stupid are under attack indirectly, because the true leaders of society are under attack. The evidence of this can be seen in all of the crumbling cities in America. Even Noam Chomsky, a renowned liberal, admits that America is in a decline.<p>Understanding the reason can start with understanding that the very very intelligent men have been shouldered out of the Ivy League schools. Men have higher quantitative reasoning ability than women. The truly magical men that should be in control of our society are being shouldered out by very intelligent women.<p>&gt;In 2005, the distinguished economist Lawrence Summers was forced to resign as President of Harvard University after expressing the view, at a seminar on diversity in the academic workplace, that in some fields the innate cognitive differences between the sexes might make the search for a perfect 50:50 gender balance impossible.<p>Mr. Summers taking damage here is an instance of the de-evolution effect of feminism that we all experience everyday.
There will never be a balance in the genders until genius men are stepped on and damaged until their phenotypes have been genocided/they no longer exist. And even in that case, if the very genius men are being stepped on, then genius women are also going to be disappearing, as the same genius men are generally their fathers."*

*"No one is "meant" to be tortured and abused. I find you reply to be morally abhorrent and absolutely disgusting.<p>Right now, at this very moment, on American highways, there are no less than 5,000 concentration camp trucks. Trucks that we’ve constructed. Inside these trucks there are living, terrified, innocent beings (such as) cows, pigs and chickens. These trucks are being driven to concentration camp slaughterhouses that we’ve carefully constructed all across America. When the trucks arrive, the animals are so frightened they won’t even get off the truck. They’re not stupid. They know what’s next. So people go on the trucks with electric prods and force them to walk down the chutes to their own death. Or if the animals are small enough to manhandle, like chickens, we’ll just grab them off the trucks and toss them inside. Inside, these innocent, living beings are hanged upside down, fully conscious. In other words, they go in alive against their will and come out chopped up into hundreds of pieces. I think this type of behavior is inexcusable and unbecoming of a species that claims to understand right from wrong. The animals have not done one single thing to us to deserve the wrath and the cruelty that we hurl on them.<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt4lweBJTQs" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt4lweBJTQs</a>"*

*"This has nothing to do with growth or even sexism/racism.  This is a political takeover and shakedown of a valueable company.  Moving out of a meritocracy to a hierarchy like this is to move away from performance based influence to political based influence.<p>The SJWs behind this just want money and they are importing their people into the company to increase their control.  The use of discrimination is part of the mechanism to increase their numbers.  Once they get a lot of people below them, they'll demand larger and larger paychecks and stock options.  That's it, it's a fairly simple plan.  Find a valuable company and raid it. All this inclusion/sexism talk is just dressing.  Even githubs ceo's motivation is pretty clear.  If he grows the org, he'll argue that he deserves more money because he's managing more people.

It reads like a cowardly billionaire who wants to grossly distort the actual concerns of real people; who doesn't want to listen to anybody who doesn't think he's a god; and who wants to live in ignorance.<p>I'm sure time is meaningful for you... but maybe you should ask him if there wasn't some reason that he suddenly finished this essay.  And if maybe it wasn't because he's a thin-skinned jerk who can't handle the fact that his previous missive was really poorly thought out... maybe he can't handle interactions with people who don't think he's a God.<p>pg has had a ton of my respect for a very long time.  But between these two essays, I've realized that pg is no longer a useful or good man.  He's passed into that world where he simply cannot accept the notion that he might sometimes be wrong; and he'd rather live in ignorance of that.  He'd rather believe he is perfect, that he is a god, than face the fact that he wrote a really terrible essay, an essay that showed a complete disconnect from reality.<p>But hey... you're married to him so you're a billionaire too, so I bet you thought his reality-deficient spew was also really great.  And that's one of the best things about being a billionaire; you can afford to live in a distorted reality that has no connection to the real world.  You can do so, and it will be comfortable for your entire family.  Nobody will say anything to your face, because you are too powerful.<p>So yes... enjoy your time... enjoy your ignorance... enjoy shitting on the world and denying reality.  Enjoy making excuses for your husband's ignorant brand of politics.  Because he's going to get worse for the rest of his life.  Rich white men rarely get <i>less</i> entitled as they age.<p>pg won't wake up and be Bill Gates, realizing that this shit is fucked up.

I might be a rude halfwit, but I know where the boundary lies.<p>Though I've mentioned it already multiple times, I'll reiterate a final time: Absolutely no concrete assurance (from CF officially) that the LuaJIT project will be developed openly. It has been moved to GitHub, distancing it from the long-appreciated mailing list and cementing it's position ion a platform that openly censors projects and actively enforces a code of conduct to further the narrative that code should take peoples' feelings into consideration. Github is widely used, and most of the alternatives suck, so it's an understandable sin.<p>On top of all that, the murky posts on the actual list indicate no significant progress has been made on figuring out a new direction for the project, and little to no effort has been made to do more than announce to the community what's (allegedly) going on.<p>Finally, the biggest disconnect between you and I is that if someone offered me money to take over a FOSS project and move to behind closed doors of a huge corporation, instead of agreeing and playing sock-puppet on mailing lists and twitter (who does that sound like?), I would out them to the community.<p>I'm not asking for you to make changes, just voicing my dissent and my intent to take aggressive, direct action."*

That presents a lot of complications, since they need to try and cycle new comments so they all receive some visibility, allowing them a chance to rise if they're of high quality.
